# ðŸŽ¥ Predicting IMDb Movie Gross Revenue

This is a group based project that I made for the course **STA302: Method of Data Analysis 1** at the University of Toronto. The objective was to build a predictive model and understand the key factors influencing a movieâ€™s **gross revenue**, a crucial measure of financial success in the film industry. Given the high production costs and the risky nature of movie investments, our analysis aims to offer evidence-based insights for filmmakers and producers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
Answer this question:

**To what extent can IMDb rating, Metascore, release year, movie genre, and production cost predict the gross revenue of movies?**

This study / report investigates how **audience reviews**, **critics** **production budgets**, and **genre choices** influence a movieâ€™s box office performance. We aim to identify statistically significant predictors that can help decision-makers allocate resources more effectively and reduce financial risk.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

We combined and cleaned two publicly available datasets from **Kaggle**:
- [IMDb Top 2000 Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/imdb-dataset-top-2000-movies): Contains IMDb ratings, release year, genres, and more.
- [The Movies Dataset by Rounak Banik](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset): Includes production budget and other metadata.

We merged the datasets by matching movie titles to ensure each observation contained all required variables: IMDb rating, Metascore, release year, genre, production budget, and gross revenue.
