# ðŸŽ¥ Predicting IMDb Movie Gross Revenue

This is a group based project that I made for the course **STA302: Method of Data Analysis 1** at the University of Toronto. The objective was to build a predictive model and understand the key factors influencing a movieâ€™s **gross revenue**, a crucial measure of financial success in the film industry. Given the high production costs and the risky nature of movie investments, our analysis aims to offer evidence-based insights for filmmakers and producers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
Answer this question:
>**To what extent can IMDb rating, Metascore, release year, movie genre, and production cost predict the gross revenue of movies?**

>This study / report investigates how audience reviews, critical acclaim, production budgets, and genre choices influence a movieâ€™s box office performance. We aim to identify statistically significant predictors that can help decision-makers allocate resources more effectively and reduce financial risk.
